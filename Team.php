					<br/>
					<p><strong>Co-founder and Community Director</strong><p/>

Since leaving prison, Mzi has led Brothers for All’s crucial revenue generation jewellery making projects, while teaching himself to code. Along with Sihle, he speaks often in the community where he is a respected voice. An entrepreneur at heart - his crime was a robbery to raise money to do up his taxi - Mzi is passionate about creating a culture of contribution and hard work amongst our students.

					<b>Sibu Gabuza</b>

					<p><strong>Students Manager</strong><p/>
					<p>
						Sibu walked into the Brothers for All Centre the week it opened. He has not stopped coding since and quickly became our top student and inspiration to every new student who has joined since.

He has become so important to the team that in 2015 we will be employing him as an official member of the team.
